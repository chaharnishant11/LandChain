# LandChain
In the modern day era, where any official work involves immense amount of corruption and still so many chances of deceit and forfeiture, we are trying to build a safe, secure and well-designed blockchain based system for realestate in India. A great chain of transactions taking account of any changes made in any piece of land can actually save the people from several thefts
and fraud cases.

## MAIN PROBLEMS: 
* fraud, forgery and selling of wrong land to the buyers.
* Selling same piece of land to more than one buyer.
* Mortgaged land being sold to the people.
* Selling by fictitious buyers or to fictitious sellers.

All these require a system involving less corruption, less paperwork and a transparent yet untamperable system that can be monitored and accessed by the officials of Government of India as well as the people of India.

## Proposed Solution
The blockchain technology is a perfect solution to solve this problem because it can maintain an immutable ledger. In a Blockchained data storage multiple peers in the network has their own replicated copy of the ledger. In addition to ledger information being distributed, the processes which update the ledger require a quorum. Moreover, in a permissioned and private blockchain, very specific data and operation access control can be specified.
